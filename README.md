# About Me
I am a proud first-generation immigrant and a senior completing my Bachelor's of Business Administration at Bernard M. Baruch College majoring in Computer Information Systems - Data Analytics Track and minoring in mathematics.

I am interested in combining programming techniques and data analytics skills to solve real-world problems in the business arena. As a minority woman, Latina, and a first-generation student, I have raised awareness of the gender gap in the tech industry and I want to reach a high achievement in the business and technology field. 

My career goal is to associate my technical and soft skills with future activities, events, conferences, and internships. I hope to expand and strengthen my technical and interpersonal skills to help contribute to the company's growth and client's benefit.

## Star Rating Prediction on Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms
The goal of this project is to use Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms to predict Amazonâ€™s product ratings from the customers' review comments and other related variables. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed before applying any models to understand the dataset better.  

The best model after hyperparameter tuning has an AUC of 0.89 with an accuracy of 0.83, a precision of 0.83, a recall of 0.99, and an f1 score of 0.9.
