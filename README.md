# About Me
I am a proud first-generation immigrant and a senior completing my Bachelor's of Business Administration at Bernard M. Baruch College majoring in Computer Information Systems - Data Analytics Track and minoring in mathematics.

I am interested in combining programming techniques and data analytics skills to solve real-world problems in the business arena. As a minority woman, Latina, and a first-generation student, I have raised awareness of the gender gap in the tech industry and I want to reach a high achievement in the business and technology field. 

My career goal is to associate my technical and soft skills with future activities, events, conferences, and internships. I hope to expand and strengthen my technical and interpersonal skills to help contribute to the company's growth and client's benefit.
